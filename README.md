## Installation

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment and Installing Requirements

To get started, you first need to create a Python virtual environment. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

This command creates a virtual environment named `env`. Next, you need to activate the virtual environment:

- **On Windows:**

```bash
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

- **On macOS or Linux:**

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

After activating the virtual environment, you can install the projectâ€™s requirements using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
